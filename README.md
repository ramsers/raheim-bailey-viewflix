<div></div>

<p>This app was an exercise in building my first API & serving that data to the React front end using Node & Express.<br>
  Video data is served up from the server and users are able to switch between videos (thumbnails) using React-Router. On the upload page
  users are able to input a video with title and description, have that posted to the server, & re-rendered on the homepage.
</p>

<h3>Functionality</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Video data served to front end from Node server</li>
  <li>Users can click a side video and have it appear as the main video</li>
  <li>Users can add their own video and have it appear on the home page</li>
</ul>
